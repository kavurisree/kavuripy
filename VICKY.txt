I Must Say this when you were on Leave ... I think that's the Worst Period that we all faced in Amazon
All 8 of us Together Decided to leave Amazon on July 15th ...I'm the 5th person to say i will leave..
I Don't think i'm wrong in saying yes in yes with all 
I Don't Know About this World But i will always stand on my word's....And I did it.
But no one knows the reason behind it including you...
I'm Sorry for taking Some Decision Without letting you know
